ask users for the:
cost of their meal, 
their local tax rate, 
and how much theyâ€™d like to tip. 

then compute:

the amount for tax, 
the pre-tip amount for the meal, 
the amount for the tip,
the total cost of the meal



pust and gets methods to be used

prompt the user to: "Enter the cost of your meal before tax"

think about: type conversion

gets will be strings
float values in order to do your arithmetic operations. 
Float() class

x = "1.45"
y = Float(x)
puts "The type of x is #{x.class}"
puts "The type of y is #{y.class}"
